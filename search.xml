The removal of paint from metal surfaces is done by either chemical stripping or by abrasion.</p><p>B    .Composite surfaces must not be chemically stripped as the strippers may attack  the resins. Therefore, only abrasion should   be used.</p><p>C.   Alternative stripping processes not referred to in  Chapter <em>51-75-11</em> to remove external paint systems can be evaluated and qualified by the  user and approved by national airworthiness authorities as documented in SAE MA4872 plus additional tests specific to AIRBUS requirements. When  using the SAE MA4872 procedure it is mandatory to first contact AIRBUS  to ascertain which additional tests will be required for the process to  be qualified.</p><p>NOTE: Tests on magnesium alloys are not required.The document SAE MA4872 is available from:</p><p>SAE 400 Commonwealth Drive Warrendale PA A5096-0001 USA</p><p>D.   Ensure that the aircraft is de-energized and grounded in accordance with  AMM Chapter 10-11-00.</p><p>E.For chemical paint stripping start from the bottom and work up. Higher the  dry film thickness of the paint scheme is, longer the stripping process  is.</p><p>F.Masking procedure for chemical paint stripping.</p><ol><li><p>Mask areas not to be stripped and areas that must be protected against paint strippers. For an example of masking refer to       Figure  002. Masking tape has to be applied to clean surfaces and the edges of the  tape pressed down with a piece of plastic to ensure good adhesion.  Select adhesive tape with the correct width to avoid to cut the tape.</p></li><li><p>For pre Modification 153214(THALES) and Modification 153213 (Old THAHLES  and GOODRICH), we recommend to apply protective cover on AOA sensors  AMM Chapter 10-11-00 and  AMM Chapter 12-21-11, or equivalent protective cover and then apply visible adhesive tape  between the base of AOA and the aircraft plate and cover with  polyethylene film and tape as shown in Figure  003 and  002.<br>$\textcolor{orange}{CAUTION:}$DO NOT STRIP THE FLAT PLATE OF THE AOA SENSOR ON THE AIRCRAFT. IF YOU DO  NOT OBEY THIS INSTRUCTION,   YOU CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE COMPONENT.</p></li><li><p>For post Modification 153214(THALES) and Modification 153213 (Old THAHLES  and GOODRICH), install flexible vinyl tape at the edge of the conical  plate. Refer to Figure  003. For post Modification 154862 install flexible vinyl tape at the edge of flat plate. Refer to Figure  003.<br>NOTE: Apply protective cover on AOA sensors  AMM Chapter 10-11-00 and  AMM Chapter 12-21-11 as additional protection.</p></li><li><p>Cover with polyethylene film and tape as shown in Figure  002. The area to be masked must include the complete AOA plate minimum 9 mm (0.35 in.) around the AOA plate as shown in Figure  003.<br>NOTE: Do not strip the paint on AOA conical plate.<br>NOTE: Painting of AOA flat plate must be performed outside the aircraft (Refer to  Chapter 51-75-12).</p></li><li><p>Complete the stripping after removal of masking by light sanding of aircraft skin.</p></li><li><p>Protect the other sensors (static, pitot and TAT) openings with a peace of plastic film, or (Material No.  15-002) (plastic side against the aircraft surface) hold in place with visible adhesive tape and cover as shown in Figure  002. The aluminium tape shall cover the plastic film entirely and overlap  into the aircraft structure.

Below 18 °C (64 °F), the stripper takes much  longer to react (up to twice as long).<br>NOTE: For surfaces larger than 5 m² (53.82 ft.²), it is preferable to apply the  paint stripper by spray.

Wet surfaces must be dried.<br>NOTE: Make sure that the cleaned surfaces to be stripped are perfectly dry before you start the next step.</p></li><li><p>Mask areas not to be stripped, and areas that must be protected against  strippers with polyethylene film (CHEMTEX AT 166 or TESA film 132 or  TESA film 659) and adhesive aluminium tape (Material No. 05-015C or  08-052).<br>NOTE: External skin panel joints (except fuel tank areas) do not have to be masked.</p></li><li><p>Apply a thick closed uniform coat of stripper (Material No.  12-013) with a non-atomizing spray or with a brush in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions.<br>NOTE: It is recommended to apply paint stripper (Material No.  12-013) by spraying using airless pump with 10:1 or higher ratio and spray  nozzle creating a wide fan type spraying pattern. Keep a distance  between 500 mm (19.7 in.) to 1500 mm (59.0 in.)Example of equipment:Airless pump 2 pcs type flowmax from KREMLINTWIST NOZZLE type 529 diameter 0.74 mm (0.029 in.)Material flow rate 1900 ml (0.5 US gal)/minEquivalent equipment is available from GRACO, airless graco pump model EHOOH with karcher lences equipped with 0.13 tips-GHD 547<br>NOTE: The skin surface temperature must not exceed 35 °C (95. °F). It is  preferable to strip at temperatures above 22 °C (72. °F) but not in hot  sunlight or rain. Below 18 °C (64. °F) it takes much longer to react.</p></li><li><p>Allow to dwell for sufficient time to lift the paint. Typically starts to  react after 1 to 2 hours with standard thin topcoat and longer with  varnish or mica colors but less than 10 hours when paint has loosened.  Keep the surface wet by reapplying a mist coat of stripper, typically  after 90 to 180 minutes (stripper tends to dry as the solvent reacts  with intermediate coat). Repeat the application as required to lift the  paint (from 1 to 4 operations).<br>NOTE: Do not use metallic scraper.<br>NOTE: Give a change to the paint stripper to penetrate the topcoat and dissolve the intermediate coat.To accelerate the removal, you can lightly abrade the areas with varnish  or mica paint, before the application of paint stripper.</p></li><li><p>Allow the top coat to lift and fall down. Remove the paint stripper and  residues (remove systematically after 10 hours) using a soft plastic  scraper (make sure not to rebond residues on the surface with the  scraper).<br>NOTE: Water rinse can be used see paragraph 6..D..(7), but make sure not to rebond the topcoat.</p></li><li><p>If the external paint system is only partially removed and to ensure that all intermediate coat has been removed, repeat steps 6..D..(3).thru 6..D..(5). In the areas where the paint was not removed between the stripper  applications, inspect and repair masking, if necessary, as described in  step 6..D..(2)above.</p></li><li><p>After the last stripper application, rinse carefully the surface, to  completely remove paint and stripper residues. Clean difficult areas  with water and SCOTCH-BRITE, rinse carefully the stripped areas with  cold or warm water up to 65 C° (149 F°) maximum (50 C° (122. F°)  preferred) with a water hose (pressure limited to 6 bar (87 psi)) or a  high pressure water cleaner (pressure max. 100 bar (1451.38 psi),  distance/angle nozzle/part 250 mm (9.84 in.)min. inclined at 45°  approximately but never at 90°), then as an option rinse with cleaning  agent (Material No.  11-001) according to  AMM Chapter 12-21-11 Page Block 301. Let the surface dry.<br>NOTE: We recommend that you use final rinse water with these minimum qualities:  PH between 5 and 8.5 and chloride content less than 100 PPM.</p></li><li><p>Remove all masking tape, films and plugs.</p></li><li><p>Inspect the areas that were stripped.</p></li><li><p>Inspect the areas that were masked for damaged paint and presence of stripper.  Any stripper remaining must be removed with a clean cloth or sponge  dampened with water. If the paint has been damaged, refer to step 6..D..(12) below.</p></li><li><p>Clean the exposed primer with cleaning agent (Material No.  11-010) or the thinner of the intermediate coat and dry it with a clean cloth.<br>NOTE: Make sure that all intermediate coat residues (white) have been removed.</p></li><li><p>Mechanically lightly abrade areas that were masked during the stripping and which  also require paint removal. Abrade also any remaining local spots of the old paint systems. Do this with emery cloth (grade 220 or 320).</p></li><li><p>Lightly abrade the stripped areas with SCOTCH-BRITE prior to repainting.</p></li><li><p>Clean the abraded area with cleaning agent (Material No.  11-003 or  11-026) and dry it with a clean cloth.</p></li><li><p>After paint stripping any exposed sealant i.e. not covered with primer, is  considered as damaged.
